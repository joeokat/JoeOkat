[Joshua](http://x.com/joeokat) is a self-taught UX Designer and a PWA Developer with a keen interest in building UIs with Figma, HTML,CSS and React.js. I am trying to be more creative and unique with Astro.js, SvelteUI Kit, Next.js and Expo. I'm available for any kind of job opportunity that suits my current skills.
