# Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif) welcome to my Github profile.

[Joshua](http://threads.net/uxjoeokat) is a self-taught UX Engineer with a keen interest in building UIs with Figma, HTML and CSS. I am trying to be more creative and unique with React.js, Next.js, Svelte.js and Expo. I'm available for any kind of job opportunity that aligns with my current skills.
